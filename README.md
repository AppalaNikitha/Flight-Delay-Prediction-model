# Flight-Delay-Prediction-model


- The Flight Delay Prediction Model leverages historical flight data and machine learning techniques to forecast flight delays accurately. 
- It involves collecting and preprocessing diverse data sources, including weather conditions and airline information.
- Features are engineered to enhance prediction accuracy, and models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting are selected and fine-tuned for optimal performance. 
- The model's reliability is evaluated using standard metrics, and insights from predictions aid in understanding factors contributing to delays. 
If Deployed for real-time predictions, it enables proactive management of flight operations with continuous monitoring and updates.
